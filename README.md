# Library_Management_System-
To create a professional Java project in NetBeans for managing library operations such as student registration, book addition, book issuance, and returns with a GUI interface, and to integrate this project with a MySQL database using SQL Workbench

## Step 1: Set Up Your Project

### Create a New Project in NetBeans:
1. **Open NetBeans**:
   - Launch the NetBeans IDE on your computer.

2. **Create a New Project**:
   - Go to the menu bar and click on `File`.
   - Select `New Project` from the dropdown menu.

3. **Select Project Type**:
   - In the `New Project` window, choose `Java` under `Categories`.
   - Select `Java Application` under `Projects`.

4. **Name Your Project**:
   - Click `Next`.
   - Enter the project name, e.g., `LibraryManagementSystem`.
   - Click `Finish`.

Your project is now set up in NetBeans and ready for development.

 ## Step 2: Design the Database

### Create Database in MySQL Workbench:
1. **Open MySQL Workbench**:
   - Launch MySQL Workbench on your computer.

2. **Create a New Schema**:
   - Click on the `Schemas` tab in the Navigator panel.
   - Right-click in the `Schemas` panel and select `Create Schema`.
   - Enter the schema name, e.g., `library_db`.
   - Click `Apply`, then `Apply` again in the SQL script window, and finally click `Finish`.

3. **Create the Necessary Tables**:
   - With the new schema selected, click on the `SQL` tab to open a new SQL query window.
   - Copy and paste the following SQL script to create the tables
  
   - ## Step 3: Connect to the Database

### Add MySQL Connector to NetBeans:

1. **Download MySQL Connector/J**:
   - Go to the [MySQL Connector/J download page](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/).
   - Download the appropriate version for your operating system.

2. **Add the Connector to Your Project**:
   - Open your project in NetBeans.
   - Right-click on your project name in the `Projects` panel.
   - Select `Properties` from the context menu.

3. **Add the Library**:
   - In the Project Properties window, select `Libraries` from the left-hand menu.
   - Click on `Add JAR/Folder`.

4. **Select the Connector**:
   - Navigate to the location where you downloaded the MySQL Connector/J JAR file.
   - Select the JAR file and click `Open`.

5. **Confirm Addition**:
   - Ensure the MySQL Connector/J JAR file is now listed under `Compile-time Libraries`.
   - Click `OK` to close the Project Properties window.
### Configure Database Connection in Your Code:

1. **Set Up Database Connection**:
   - In your project, create a new class for managing the database connection, e.g., `DatabaseConnection.java`.
   - Add the following code to establish a connection to your MySQL database:

     ```java
     import java.sql.Connection;
     import java.sql.DriverManager;
     import java.sql.SQLException;

     public class DatabaseConnection {
         private static final String URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/library_db";
         private static final String USER = "your-username";
         private static final String PASSWORD = "your-password";

         public static Connection getConnection() throws SQLException {
             return DriverManager.getConnection(URL, USER, PASSWORD);
         }
     }
     ```

2. **Use the Database Connection**:
   - In your application code, use `DatabaseConnection.getConnection()` to get a connection to the database when needed.

Your project is now configured to connect to the MySQL database.
